                                use our services,
                                such as the content you engage with or the frequency and duration of your

                                b) <strong>Precise Geolocation:</strong> The website collects your precise geolocation
                                with your
                                permission for providing you convenient features of our website. If you decline
                                permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it, but then you will

                                while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the website. In other words, when you
                                access the website, we are aware of your usage of the website, and gather, collect and
                                record the information relating to such usage, including geo-location information,
                                number of views, referral link, operating system, make & ID, IP address, device ID and

                                technologies that may uniquely identify a device. This helps Viewz in providing our
                                services to the users and making improvements in the Site and our services, fixing
                                errors and bugs. <br><br>

                                social media platforms or mobile applications. When you engage with us through social
                                media platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn, you allow us to have access
                                to certain information from your social media profile based upon your privacy preference
                                settings on such platforms. <br><br>
                                e) <strong>Payments:</strong> When you make the payment on Viewz, then you provide our
                                third-party
                                payment service provider with your credit or debit card information. We don’t collect
                                your payment card details. For payments, we redirect you to our third-party payment

                                collect all your interactions with our customer support. <br><br>
