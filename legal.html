                                use our services,
                                such as the content you engage with or the frequency and duration of your

                                b) <strong>Precise Geolocation:</strong> The website collects your precise geolocation
                                with your
                                permission for providing you convenient features of our website. If you decline
                                permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it, but then you will

                                while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the website. In other words, when you
                                access the website, we are aware of your usage of the website, and gather, collect and
                                record the information relating to such usage, including geo-location information,
                                number of views, referral link, operating system, make & ID, IP address, device ID and

                                technologies that may uniquely identify a device. This helps Viewz in providing our
                                services to the users and making improvements in the Site and our services, fixing
                                errors and bugs. <br><br>

                                social media platforms or mobile applications. When you engage with us through social
                                media platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram or LinkedIn, you allow us to have access
                                to certain information from your social media profile based upon your privacy preference
                                settings on such platforms. <br><br>
                                e) <strong>Payments:</strong> When you make the payment on Viewz, then you provide our

                                payment service provider with your credit or debit card information. We don’t collect
                                your payment card details. For payments, we redirect you to our third-party payment

                                collect all your interactions with our customer support. <br><br>

                                and our Terms & Conditions posted on the website, and as updated from time to time.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Service Description</strong> <br> <br>
                                a) <strong>Service:</strong> Viewz offers various content, features and functionalities
                                on the website.
                                When you purchase our Subscription plans, you will be provided with a license to one or
                                more of the content, features and functionalities available on the website on a limited
                                license basis. <br> <br>
                                b) <strong>License: </strong> Viewz grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
                                non-transferable,
                                non-sublicensable license to access and use the features of the subscription plan for
                                which you have paid all required fees, solely, in accordance with our <strong>Terms &
                                    Conditions</strong>
                                posted on the Site. All other uses are expressly prohibited. <br> <br>
                                c) <strong>Free Plan:</strong> Whenever you use our services in any of our free
                                subscription plans, you
                                grant us a legal permission (known as a ‘license’) to use any and all digital assets
                                that you create using our free plan. We have the right to use such digital asset of
                                yours for the purposes of advertising or design or marketing or sale or for all of the
                                above.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Cancel At Any Time</strong> <br> <br>
                                Paid plans are subscriptions that auto-renew by default. You can cancel auto-renewal at
                                any time to cancel your subscription. Cancelling auto-renew prevents your payment method
                                from being charged at your next billing date. Your current subscription (the time you
                                already paid for) isn’t affected, so you’ll continue to be able to access and benefit
                                from paid features until your next billing date.</p>
                            <p><strong>4. No Refunds</strong> <br> <br>
                                Since we offer a service, therefore, once you purchase the subscription, your
                                subscription shall become final, and the same cannot be refunded under any circumstance
                                and for any reason whatsoever. However, you can cancel the subscription at any time, but
                                the same will terminate only at the end of your current billing cycle. Moreover, if you
                                face any issues with any of our services, please write to us at <a
                                        href="mailto:viewzsupport@avrhub.com">viewzsupport@avrhub.com</a>
                                and we will try our best to sort it out at our sole discretion. <strong>To cancel,
                                    please write

                                ● Without limiting the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to: (i) revoke any
                                stated offer; (ii) correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omission; and (iii) make changes
